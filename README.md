# Compromised

Developed with Unreal Engine 5
This is the source code of the game "Compromised" that I am building.

In Compromised, the main character, is an everyday worker in a facility when one day after oversleeping wakes up to the facility devoid of people and on the brink of malfunction, 
To survive he, manages the whole place, doing tasks to keep the facility alive for each day, while slowly uncovering what happened to the place. 
However as you continue to do tasks there will be “something” looking for ypu as you continue to do your tasks to keep the facility afloat. 
This will continue until you can get the task functions to 100% without running out of time for each task.
